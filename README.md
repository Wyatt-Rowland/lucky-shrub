This project is for course 4 (of 9) in Meta's Front-End Developer Certicate course through Coursera. 

The goal is to design a homepage for a fictional business. I have decided to go with Lucky Shrub. 

This is their description: 
    "Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".

    Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery."

Client Info:
    Medium sized
    Specializes in garden design, creation, maintence, and landscaping
    Small nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants
    Allows clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of"


The project helps showcase skills in designing, styling, and adding effects to a layout. JS is not a requirement for this project so I will refrain from using it for the time. 

This is a peer-reviewed project, so others in this course will have the chance to criticize for further improvements. I do need to work on my READMEs. 

I was originally confused as to what images to use, as the course only provides the logo. I did find allomhg on github, who did this project, and saw where he found his images. 

All images are from pexels.com, and should be free to use.
